## Welcome to fur.ink! ðŸ‘‹

We are a small team of 6 developers developing [fur.ink](https://fur.ink), an artist commissioning and payments platform.

Our aim is to create a modern alternative to existing platforms like FurAffinity or ~Twitter~ / X, allowing artists to post commission information to their audience, and users to find artists with styles that suit their wants and price range. We embrace the open-source world, and our frontend applications, including the website and mobile app, are all open-source under a dual MIT or Apache 2.0 license.

## Projects

- [@furink/web](https://github.com/furinkapp/furink/tree/main/apps/web) - our core web application, accessible at [www.fur.ink](https://fur.ink).
- [@furink/mobile](https://github.com/furinkapp/furink/tree/main/apps/mobile) - our mobile application, for on-the-go posting and info devouring.

## Teams

For organisational purposes, work in fur.ink is split up into a number of teams, each working on a different area of the project.

- The **development** team is responsible for developing the software that makes fur.ink work.
  - The **frontend** team consists of the frontend developers working on the web and mobile apps.
  - The **backend** team consists of the backend developers working on internal services and the public API.
- The **design** team is responsible for making the aforementioned software look reasonable!
- The **DevOps** team works their magic in the background and lets the public access fur.ink.

## Contributions

Contributions are very much welcome! Have a look at our contribution guidelines, then open a feature request or bug report in the [issues repository](https://github.com/furinkapp/issues/issues). You will find more information on contributing there.

The backend is currently closed source and not accepting contributions, but we are actively working on a public API to allow automation of information, as well as webhook support to enable users to create custom feeds for commission information.
